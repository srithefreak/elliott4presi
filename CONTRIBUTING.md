If you want to contribute, just fork the repository and then make your changes. Submit a pull request and please test your changes before you make a pull request and make changes accordingly. I will go through pull requests and decided whether to merge them or not. You can also take up any issues in the repository if you want but the first person to ask to be assigned gets the job unless I think I can get it done. This is a React project so all logic is React-based.
