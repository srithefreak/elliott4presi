# Issues
You can take up any issues in the repository if you want but the first person to ask to be assigned gets the job unless I think I can get it done. If you are making a issue besides security, bugs, or features, please assign the "Other" label so we can keep track of issues.
# Pull requests
Just fork the repository and then make your changes. Open a pull request and give a description of what you changed, why, and how along with a appropiate title. Submit the pull request and please test your changes before you make a pull request and make changes accordingly.
