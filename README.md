# Elliott for President

A website for my friend running off inside joke that he is running for president. I also wanted to use this project to
work with React and just explore it but that did not work out. I do not intend to make this an actual domain, and I am
using GitHub Pages for my backend. I do hope to gain experience with DigitalOcean and want to make something on their
App Platform which might mean the deployment of this site might change.
