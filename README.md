# Elliott for President
A website for my friend running off inside joke that he is running for president. I also wanted to use this project to
work with React and just explore it but that did not work out. I do not intend to make this an actual domain, and I am
using GitHub Pages for my backend. I do hope to gain experience with Azure and I might migrate it to their static web
pages service in the future.
